# Java bogo sort

Have you ever had a list of 10 random integers and thought to yourself: "Wow I wish there was a stupidly inefficient way to sort these"? Have I got the program for you.

Bogo sort, or stupid sort, is an iterative sorting algorithm that consists of randomly shuffling the elements of a data structure and checking if they are correctly 	sorted. If not, repeat. Since a bogo sort's performance depends entirely on probability, the worst case is not measureable.

Best case: O(n)

Worst case: ♾️
